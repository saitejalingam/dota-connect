# DotA Connect
DotA 2 is a free-to-play multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed and published by Valve Corporation.
DotA has a staggering player base of 13 million monthly active players and an average of 500-600k players active at any given time.

DotA is a team game, having friends to play it with makes it that much more fun and worthwhile.
Most players meet each other online through the game’s matchmaking system, which puts together random players of the same caliber.
You can add strangers who you’ve enjoyed playing with as friends, but cannot communicate with them unless they’re online in the game.
You play with people from all over the world, so exchanging information like phone numbers is not always viable nor safe.

This application allows friends to communicate and plan game time together without compromising anonymity.
Integration with Steam lets you login with your Steam ID and find all of your friends right there.
Features like Favorite, Search, Quick Invite, and Messaging allow users to seamlessly communicate with other users of the app.
